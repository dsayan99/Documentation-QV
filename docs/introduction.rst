Introduction
============

Welcome to QVision
------------------

QVision is a cutting-edge Cryptographic Inventory Management Platform
designed to empower organizations with comprehensive visibility into
their cryptographic infrastructure. Built to address the evolving
cybersecurity landscape, QVision provides an end-to-end solution for
discovering, analyzing, and managing cryptographic artifacts across
networks, applications, and devices.

Why QVision?
------------

In todayâ€™s digital age, cryptography serves as the backbone of secure
communications and data protection. However, many organizations face
challenges such as limited visibility into their cryptographic usage,
non-compliance with standards, and the risk of vulnerabilities due to
outdated algorithms. QVision bridges this gap by offering:

-  Comprehensive Risk Assessment: Generate detailed cryptographic
   inventories, identify insecure cryptography, and gain actionable
   insights for mitigation.

-  Regulatory Compliance: Ensure adherence to standards like PCI DSS,
   NIST SP 800-52, ISO 27000, and more, reducing the risk of penalties.

-  Efficient Cryptography Management: Visualize, monitor, and manage
   cryptographic artifacts, and transition seamlessly to
   quantum-resistant cryptography.

-  Cryptographic Agility: Adapt quickly to emerging threats and maintain
   a robust cryptographic posture.

Key Features
------------

-  Cryptographic Inventory: Discover and catalog cryptographic objects,
   including keys, certificates, algorithms, and protocols.

-  Compliance Analysis: Detect and address policy violations, expired
   certificates, weak keys, and deprecated protocols.

-  Interactive Dashboard: Gain insights into the cryptographic health of
   your organization with a user-friendly interface.

-  Quantum-Safe Migration: Prepare for future threats by adopting
   quantum-resistant cryptographic standards.

-  Integration: Seamlessly integrates with tools like tcpdump, Zeek, and
   industry-standard network devices for enhanced functionality.

Target Audience
---------------

QVision is tailored for:

-  IT Security Teams: For managing cryptographic hygiene and ensuring
   compliance.

-  Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs): For offering
   cryptographic auditing as a service.

-  Auditors and Compliance Teams: For assessing and reporting on
   cryptographic health.

How QVision Works
-----------------

QVision operates through two main components:

1. **QCapture**: A front-end module that preprocesses network traffic
   (e.g., PCAP files) to remove sensitive payloads.

2. **QVision Dashboard**: An analysis dashboard for monitoring
   cryptographic usage, identifying vulnerabilities, and enforcing
   compliance policies.

Whether you're seeking to enhance your cryptographic inventory
management or prepare for a quantum-secure future, QVision provides the
tools and insights to achieve your security goals effectively.
