QCapture: Preprocessing Network Traffic
=======================================

Overview
--------

QCapture is a critical component of the QVision platform, responsible
for preprocessing PCAP files uploaded by users. It extracts
cryptographic information such as cryptographic algorithms, protocols,
and certificates from the files. Once processed, the extracted data is
automatically uploaded to the QVision Dashboard for detailed analysis
and compliance monitoring.

Installation and Setup
----------------------

This section provides step-by-step instructions for installing and
setting up the components of the QVision platform. Follow these
instructions carefully to ensure a successful deployment.

**QCapture**

QCapture is delivered as a software package that can be installed on a
virtual machine (VM). The following steps guide you through the
installation and initial setup of QCapture.

System Requirements
-------------------

Ensure your virtual machine meets the following minimum specifications
(replace with actual values later if needed):

-  **CPU**: 4 cores

-  **RAM**: 8 GB

-  **Storage**: 100 GB

-  **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or compatible Linux
   distribution

-  **Network**: Internet access for communication with the QVision
   Dashboard

Installation Steps
------------------

1. **Download the QCapture Package**:

   -  Obtain the installation package from the official PQStation portal
      or the provided download link.

2. **Prepare the Virtual Machine**:

   -  Set up a VM with the required specifications.

   -  Ensure all necessary dependencies (e.g., Docker, Python runtime)
      are installed.

3. **Install QCapture**:

   -  Copy the installation package to the VM.

   -  Run the installer using the command:

sudo bash install_qcapture.sh

-  Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation.

4. **Configure QCapture**:

   -  Access the QCapture software through a web browser:

http://<vm-ip-address>:<port>

-  Log in using the default credentials provided during installation
   (update these later for security).

-  Specify the directory for storing processed PCAP files.

Testing the Installation
------------------------

-  Upload a sample PCAP file to verify the installation.

-  Check if the cryptographic logs are processed and uploaded to the
   QVision Dashboard.

QVision Dashboard
-----------------

The QVision Dashboard is hosted on PQStation's cloud infrastructure and
is accessible via a secure link. It operates as a software-as-a-service
(SaaS) platform, enabling users to access cryptographic analysis and
compliance monitoring anytime without local installation.
